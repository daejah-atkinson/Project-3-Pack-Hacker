# Pack Hacker

## Description

Pack Hacker is a packing application to help people who have a hard time packing appropriately for trips. Users put in their travel destination and dates and the application gives them recommended items to pack based on weather information for the date and location they are traveling to, such as a winter coat if it's going to be cold, a swimsuit if it's going to be hot, or an umbrella if it's going to rain. Users can delete unnecessary items from their their or add new items.

## Technologies Used

Utilized React.js components for the front-end of the application that creates a packing list with item recommendations based on the weather and location during the userâ€™s travel dates. Used AccuWeather API to find location and weather data. Made RESTful API fetch calls to an Express, MongoDB, Node.js backend handling all create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations. Used Mongoose to define schemas for MongoDB collections.
